abstract="Recurrent Neural Networks, with the prominence of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy in several emerging Artificial Intelligence tasks. Nevertheless, the highest performing LSTM models are becoming increasingly demanding in terms of computational and memory load. At the same time, emerging latency-sensitive applications including mobile robots and autonomous vehicles often operate under stringent computation time constraints. In this paper, we address the challenge of deploying computationally demanding LSTMs at a constrained time budget by introducing an approximate computing scheme that combines iterative low-rank compression and pruning, along with a novel FPGA-based LSTM architecture. Combined in an end-to-end framework, the approximation method parameters are optimised and the architecture is configured to address the problem of high-performance LSTM execution in time-constrained applications. Quantitative evaluation on a real-life image captioning application indicates that the proposed system required up to 6.5{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}less time to achieve the same application-level accuracy compared to a baseline method, while achieving an average of 25{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}higher accuracy under the same computation time constraints.",

abstract = { The Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) are a popular class of machine learning models for analyzing sequential data. Their training on modern GPUs, however, is limited by the GPU memory capacity. Our profiling results of the LSTM RNN-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model reveal that feature maps of the attention and RNN layers form the memory bottleneck, and runtime is unevenly distributed across different layers when training on GPUs. Based on these two observations, we propose to recompute the feature maps of the attention and RNN layers rather than stashing them persistently in the GPU memory. While the idea of feature map recomputation has been considered before, existing solutions fail to deliver satisfactory footprint reduction, as they do not address two key challenges. For each feature map recomputation to be efficient, its effect on (1) the total memory footprint, and (2) the total execution time has to be carefully estimated. To this end, we propose Echo, a new compiler-based optimization scheme that addresses the first challenge with a practical mechanism that estimates the memory benefits of recomputation over the entire computation graph, and the second challenge by non-conservatively estimating the recomputation runtime overhead leveraging layer specifics. Echo reduces the GPU memory footprint automatically and transparently without any changes required to the training source code, and is effective for models beyond LSTM RNNs. We evaluate Echo on numerous state-of-the-art machine learning workloads, including NMT, DeepSpeech2, Transformer, and ResNet, on real systems with modern GPUs and observe footprint reduction ratios of 1. 89x on average and 3. 13x maximum. Such reduction can be converted into faster training with a larger batch size, savings in GPU energy consumption (e.g., training with one GPU as fast as with four), and/or an increase in the maximum number of layers under the same GPU memory budget. Echo is open-sourced as a part of the MXNet 2.0 framework. 11https://issues.apache.org/jirdprojects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-1450 },

Symbolic sequences of different complexity are generated to simulate RNN training and study parameter configurations with a view to the network's capability of learning and inference. We compare Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and gated recurrent units (GRUs). We find that an increase in RNN depth does not necessarily result in better memorization capability when the training time is constrained. Our results also indicate that the learning rate and the number of units per layer are among the most important hyper-parameters to be tuned.

ABSTRACT = {For several stakeholders, including market players, customers, grid operators, policy-makers, investors, and energy efficiency initiatives, having a precise estimate of power pricing is crucial. It is easier for traders to plan, purchase, and sell power transactions with access to accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF). Although energy production and consumption topics are widely discussed in the literature, EPF and renewable energy trading studies receive less attention, especially for intraday market modeling and forecasting. Considering the rapid development of renewable energy sources, the article highlights the significance of integrating the deep learning model, long short-term memory (LSTM), with the proper trading strategy for short-term hourly renewable energy trading by utilizing two different spot markets. Day-ahead and intraday markets are taken into account for the West Denmark grid region (DK1). The time series analysis indicates that LSTM yields superior results compared to other benchmark machine learning algorithms. Using the predictions obtained by LSTM and the recommended trading strategy, promising profit values are achieved for the DK1 wind and solar energy use case, which ensures future motivation to develop a general and flexible model for global data.},

ABSTRACT={In our previous work we have shown that resistive cross point devices, so called Resistive Processing Unit (RPU) devices, can provide significant power and speed benefits when training deep fully connected networks as well as convolutional neural networks. In this work, we further extend the RPU concept for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) namely LSTMs. We show that the mapping of recurrent layers is very similar to the mapping of fully connected layers and therefore the RPU concept can potentially provide large acceleration factors for RNNs as well. In addition, we study the effect of various device imperfections and system parameters on training performance. Symmetry of updates becomes even more crucial for RNNs; already a few percent asymmetry results in an increase in the test error compared to the ideal case trained with floating point numbers. Furthermore, the input signal resolution to the device arrays needs to be at least 7 bits for successful training. However, we show that a stochastic rounding scheme can reduce the input signal resolution back to 5 bits. Further, we find that RPU device variations and hardware noise are enough to mitigate overfitting, so that there is less need for using dropout. Here we attempt to study the validity of the RPU approach by simulating large scale networks. For instance, the models studied here are roughly 1500 times larger than the more often studied multilayer perceptron models trained on the MNIST dataset in terms of the total number of multiplication and summation operations performed per epoch. }}

abstract={Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are local in space and time and closely related to a biological model of memory in the prefrontal cortex. Not only are they more biologically plausible than previous artificial RNNs, they also outperformed them on many artificially generated sequential processing tasks. This encouraged us to apply LSTM to more realistic problems, such as the recognition of spoken digits. Without any modification of the underlying algorithm, we achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based recognisers on both the TIDIGITS and TI46 speech corpora. We conclude that LSTM should be further investigated as a biologically plausible basis for a bottom-up, neural net-based approach to speech recognition.},

abstract = {Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a popular Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm known for its ability to effectively analyze and process sequential data with long-term dependencies. Despite its popularity, the challenge of effectively initializing and optimizing RNN-LSTM models persists, often hindering their performance and accuracy. This study presents a systematic literature review (SLR) using an in-depth four-step approach based on the PRISMA methodology, incorporating peer-reviewed articles spanning 2018–2023. It aims to address how weight initialization and optimization techniques can bolster RNN-LSTM performance. This SLR offers a detailed overview across various applications and domains, and stands out by comprehensively analyzing modeling techniques, datasets, evaluation metrics, and programming languages associated with these networks. The findings of this SLR provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to enhance RNN-LSTM networks and achieve superior results.}

TITLE = {Hybrid LSTM–Transformer Architecture with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for High-Accuracy Gold Futures Price Forecasting},
JOURNAL = {Mathematics},
VOLUME = {13},
YEAR = {2025},
NUMBER = {10},
ARTICLE-NUMBER = {1551},

ABSTRACT = {Amidst global economic fluctuations and escalating geopolitical risks, gold futures, as a pivotal safe-haven asset, demonstrate price dynamics that directly impact investor decision-making and risk mitigation effectiveness. Traditional forecasting models face significant limitations in capturing long-term trends, addressing abrupt volatility, and mitigating multi-source noise within complex market environments characterized by nonlinear interactions and extreme events. Current research predominantly focuses on single-model approaches (e.g., ARIMA or standalone neural networks), inadequately addressing the synergistic effects of multimodal market signals (e.g., cross-market index linkages, exchange rate fluctuations, and policy shifts) and lacking the systematic validation of model robustness under extreme events. Furthermore, feature selection often relies on empirical assumptions, failing to uncover non-explicit correlations between market factors and gold futures prices. A review of the global literature reveals three critical gaps: (1) the insufficient integration of temporal dependency and global attention mechanisms, leading to imbalanced predictions of long-term trends and short-term volatility; (2) the neglect of dynamic coupling effects among cross-market risk factors, such as energy ETF-metal market spillovers; and (3) the absence of hybrid architectures tailored for high-frequency noise environments, limiting predictive utility for decision support. This study proposes a three-stage LSTM–Transformer–XGBoost fusion framework. Firstly, XGBoost-based feature importance ranking identifies six key drivers from thirty-six candidate indicators: the NASDAQ Index, S&P 500 closing price, silver futures, USD/CNY exchange rate, China’s 1-year Treasury yield, and Guotai Zhongzheng Coal ETF. Second, a dual-channel deep learning architecture integrates LSTM for long-term temporal memory and Transformer with multi-head self-attention to decode implicit relationships in unstructured signals (e.g., market sentiment and climate policies). Third, rolling-window forecasting is conducted using daily gold futures prices from the Shanghai Futures Exchange (2015–2025). Key innovations include the following: (1) a bidirectional LSTM–Transformer interaction architecture employing cross-attention mechanisms to dynamically couple global market context with local temporal features, surpassing traditional linear combinations; (2) a Dynamic Hierarchical Partition Framework (DHPF) that stratifies data into four dimensions (price trends, volatility, external correlations, and event shocks) to address multi-driver complexity; (3) a dual-loop adaptive mechanism enabling endogenous parameter updates and exogenous environmental perception to minimize prediction error volatility. This research proposes innovative cross-modal fusion frameworks for gold futures forecasting, providing financial institutions with robust quantitative tools to enhance asset allocation optimization and strengthen risk hedging strategies. It also provides an interpretable hybrid framework for derivative pricing intelligence. Future applications could leverage high-frequency data sharing and cross-market risk contagion models to enhance China’s influence in global gold pricing governance.},

abstract = {Oil companies are among the largest companies in the world whose economic indicators in the global stock market have a great impact on the world economy (Stevens, 2018) and market due to their relation to gold (Aijaz et al., 2016), crude oil (Henriques \& Sadorsky, 2008), and the dollar (Huang et al., 1996). This study investigates the impact of correlated features on the interpretability of long short-term memory (LSTM) (Peters, 2001) models for predicting oil company stocks. To achieve this, we designed a standard long short-term memory (LSTM) network and trained it using various correlated data sets. Our approach is aimed at improving the accuracy of stock price prediction by considering the multiple factors affecting the market, such as crude oil prices, gold prices, and the US dollar. The results demonstrate that adding a feature correlated with oil stocks does not improve the interpretability of LSTM models. These findings suggest that while LSTM models may be effective in predicting stock prices, their interpretability may be limited. Caution should be exercised when relying solely on LSTM models for stock price prediction as their lack of interpretability may make it difficult to fully understand the underlying factors driving stock price movements. We have employed complexity analysis to support our argument, considering that financial markets encompass a form of physical complex system (Peters, 2001). One of the fundamental challenges faced in utilizing LSTM models for financial markets lies in interpreting the unexpected feedback dynamics within them.},

abstract = {Recently, the adversarial attack and defense technology has made remarkable achievements and has been widely applied in the computer vision field, promoting its rapid development in other fields, primarily the natural language processing domain. However, discrete semantic texts bring additional restrictions and challenges to successfully implementing adversarial attacks and defenses. This survey systematically summarizes the current progress of adversarial techniques in the natural language processing field. We first briefly introduce the textual adversarial example’s particularity, vectorization, and evaluation metrics. More importantly, we categorize textual adversarial attacks according to the combination of semantic granularity and example generation strategy. Next, we present commonly used datasets and adversarial attack applications in diverse natural language processing tasks. Besides, we classify defense strategies as passive and active methods considering both input data and victim models. Finally, we present several challenging issues and future research directions in this domain.}
